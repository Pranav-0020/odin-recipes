    <p class = "des">Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with 
    tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven</p>
    <h2 class = "heading" id = "pizza">Ingredients required</h2>
    <h3 class = "heading" id = "pizza">For the pizza base:</h3>
    <ul class = "list">
      <li>1 and 1/4 cups wheat flour</li>
      <li>teaspoon active dry roast</li> 
      <li>1/4 cup + 1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class = "heading" id = "pizza">For the topping:</h3>
    <ul class = "list">
      <li>1/4 cup paneer</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper powder</li> 
      <li>1 teaspoon tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cup mozarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 cup capsicum cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon pizza sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup big onion cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class = "heading" id = "pizza">Instructions for making the pizza:</h3>
    <ol class = "list">
      <li>In 1/4 cup warm water, add sugar and yeast set aside for 10mins.
      You will see the mixture frothing this ensure that your yeast is active. 
      This test is only for active dry yeast, if you are using instant yeast then skip this step and proceed to next step.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl add the yeast solution, oil and salt whisk it well.</li>
      <li>Then add wheat flour and mix well. Add remaining 1/4 cup water.</li>
      <li>Mix well and knead it to form a smooth pilable dough.</li>
      <li>Keep it in a warm place undisturbed for 2 hrs. When u check after 2 hrs, the dough would have been raised. 
      Now punch it down incase for any air bubbles.</li>
      <li>I divided the dough to  make 2 small pizzas. Roll the dough to a thin base and cut it out with a lid to get perfect circles.
      Prick the base with fork to make sure of even cooking and to avoid puffing up.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven for 150 degree Celsius for 10 mins.</li>
      <li>Add tomato sauce and freshly crushed pepper,oregano and mix well, Set aside.</li>
      <li>Grease a baking tray with little oil and sprinkle little flour.</li>
      <li>Transfer the rolled pizzas to the baking tray, and bake in preheated oven for 7-9mins.</li>
      <li>Once the pizza base is ready brush it with milk. 
      Alternatively,If you want to bake both the base and topping together then at this stage 
      add the topping and bake at 200 deg C for 15-20 mins.</li>
      <li>Spread pastaa sauce on the pizza base.</li>
      <li>First add half of grated cheese then arrange the toppings - I've used onion, capsicum and paneer.</li>
      <li>Then add remaining grated cheese.While you arrange the toppings, preheat oven at 200 deg C for 10mins.</li>
      <li>Once both the pizzas are ready, bake in preheated oven for 5-mins until cheese melts and the base turns 
      golden brown at the edges. After removing from oven add oregano, chilli flakes cut into wedges and enjoy!</li>
      <li>Serve Veg Pizza hot always!!</li>
